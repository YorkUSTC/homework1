# homework1

## introduction

This little App is Used to generate homework for Primary school students.
To be honest, there will be no Primary school homework. In fact, this App is my homework. Just a joke.

## How to run

Make sure you have installed python3.7 or higher vision as well as PyQt5.
Make sure you are in the catalog, and run
> python ./work1.py

## Report

There is the report.

* Time planned to use: 5Hours
* Time actually spent (Almost)
** 2Hours to pick PyQt5 
** 1Hour to design
** 2Hours to code
** 4Hours to debug&test&commit
** 9Hours totally

I think I'm too young and too naive. And there is so many functions to be finished.
However, the App has meet the basic needs, so this is my homework1.
